# Survey Taker

Many businesses would like the ability to administer surveys against their customer base in the Clarify Environment. Survey Taker allows them to both set up
and administer surveys using a simple GUI; there is no coding or database knowledge required. In addition, surveys can be set up and administered for contacts, sites, business organizations, or cases.
Surveys can be launched from any form in the Clarify Classic Client, or from business rules.
